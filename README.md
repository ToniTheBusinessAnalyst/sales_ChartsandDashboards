# sales_ChartsandDashboards
Completed Coursera Project in which I utilized Microsoft Excel to create a dashboard. 

In this project, I was presented with the data in the uploaded file in the "Sales Data" sheet. I proceeded to create pivot tables to represent: Sales by Month, Sales by Salesperson, Sales Profits by city, Percentage of Sales by Category, and Sales by product type. I created charts for each, but one, of these pivot tables and added them to the first sheet to showcase the analysis of the data.
